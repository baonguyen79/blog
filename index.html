	<h1>New movies release in 2017</h1>
	<section>
		<p>
		2017 movie-going will be filled with sequels, superheroes, and reboots. More than 20 sequels are coming throughout the year. The Fast & Furious gang, Transformers’ Autobots and the evil Decepticons and Pirates of the Caribbean crew return during the spring and summer months.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Other sequels include xXx 3: The Return of Xander Cage, War for the Planet of the Apes, Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 2, Underworld: Blood Wars, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter, Fifty Shades Darker, Annabelle 2, Cars 3, Thor: Rangarok, Cloverfield 2017 and John Wick: Chapter 2. And of course, the highly anticipated and “much darker” Star Wars: Episode VIII in December 2017.</p>
		
		<p>
		
		Marvel Studios and DC Entertainment will once again battle for superhero supremacy. DC will launch Wonder Woman and Justice League in June and November, respectively. Sony and Marvel finally team-up to bring a rebooted Spider-Man to the screen with Tom Holland playing Peter Parker (the same role he originated in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War). The Marvel Cinematic Universe continues further with the third installment of Thor and second installment (aka “volume 2”) of Guardians of the Galaxy (return of the Groot!). The last go around of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in Logan and Warner Bros’ The LEGO Batman Movie will also be released. 
		</p>

		<p>
		The reboot trend will continue with so called “re-imagined” takes on franchises and established properties. Dwayne Johnson leads the cast of a Baywatch feature film and a new Jumanji film, which is set 20 years after the 1995 Robin Williams starring film. Expect to see a new Power Rangers and Harrison Ford/Ryan Gosling team-up Blade Runner 2049, as well as new all animated Smurfs: The Lost Village. Universal will attempt to establish a classic “monsters” franchise universe with the launch of The Mummy (starring Tom Cruise), which is a much different take than the recent 1999 film of the same name.

	<h1>Learn to fix car yourself </h1>

	<section>

	<p>		
	Car repairs can drain your pocketbook fast, but you can do a wide range of repairs yourself, regardless of your technical skill. We're not just talking oil changes; provided you can hold a wrench, you can fix everything ranging from fuel filters to alternators. We'll detail the tools necessary for your DIY toolkit, where to turn to for help when you're making the repairs, and how to tackle some of the most common car problems yourself.

	</p>

	<p>
	The biggest hurdle in convincing someone they can handle car repair is the fear factor, but here's the thing: It's actually pretty hard to permanently screw up a car. You might break something temporarily, or a fix might not work in the long run, but you probably won't set yourself or your car on fire just because you banged too hard on a valve. Cars are resilient machines and regardless of the year or make, there are plenty of repairs even the clumsiest and technically challenged can handle provided they have the confidence to push through.

	<h1>Building hometheater</h1>
	<section>
		<p>You're ready for a home theater set-up, and you're quivering with anticipation at the thought of a fully immersive movie experience right in your own home. But there's that one nagging question: <br>

		Where do you begin? <br>

		There are so many variables to consider, both technical and financial. Consider, for example, that a home theater can set you back anywhere from $1,000 to $25,000 — and more. Or that Amazon lists more than 700 possibilities for home theater speakers. With so many options, rigging up your home theater can be a head-spinning exercise.<br>

		But take heart. Even the most non-tech-savvy home theater newbie can do a whole lot to maximize their home theater experience, no matter what the price range. Here's what you need to know.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		The Room

		Most likely, you know where you'll locate your set-up. It might be the main living area, a spare bedroom or a basement movie palace complete with a popcorn machine. While each of these spaces has special considerations in terms of comfort and sound quality, there are many common factors.

		• Room shape. Square rooms tend to produce odd harmonic distortions. If you have the choice, opt for a rectangular room, and plan to place your display screen and main speakers along a short wall for best sound projection.

		• Windows. The fewer, the better. Windows are a double bugaboo: They're hard surfaces that reflect sound-causing audio distortion, and they admit light that can produce reflections on your viewing surface.

		Heavy curtains and shades help, but that means closing blinds or drapes every time you turn on your home theater system. If you must, opt for blackout-style window treatments that track tight against window jambs to seal out light.
	</section>
	<section>
		• Walls.
		 If you're tempted to staple inverted egg cartons all over your walls to muffle sound, relax. Regular drywall is a decent surface appropriate for home theater walls. However, break up large flat surfaces with furniture or drapes. Don't add framed art with glass — it's too reflective of sound and light.

		Concrete or concrete block is simply a no-no. If you're setting up in a basement with concrete walls, consider installing studs and drywall.

		Other options include acoustic wall panels designed specifically for home theaters. These panels are called "sound absorption" panels, and they help modulate low and high frequencies, preventing echoes. Panels come as 1' x 1' or 2' x 2' squares costing $4 to $20 per square foot.

		At $2 to $4, peel-and-stick carpet tiles are the budget-minded alternative. You just don't want to end up with a room that looks like Lloyd and Harry's shaggy van from Dumb and Dumber.

		Remember sound abatement cuts both ways. Controlling the sound in your home theater room means peace and quiet for the rest of your house.

		• Flooring. Wall-to-wall carpet, with a new cushy pad underneath, absorbs ambient sound and contributes to coziness. Kids like to sprawl on the floor to watch stuff, and you never know when some romantic comedies might get you and a loved one rolling on the carpet. With laughter, of course.

		• Wall/room color. Paint your walls as dark as you can stand them: Bright colors reflect light that's especially distracting when there's a brightly lit scene on the screen. Stay away from gloss or semi-gloss sheens, choosing reflection-fighting eggshell or flat paint instead.

		Go with neutral browns, tans and olive. Stronger colors, such as red and blue, will give an odd cast to any ambient light and may affect the colors you see on your screen.

	<h1>Subwoofer</h1>
	<section>
	PULSE Subwoofer <br>
	<p>Addressing the sonic potential of the PULSE soundbar, the new PULSE sub wirelessly pairs to the multichannel speaker via Bluesound’s BluOS app.
	</p>
	“Though the PULSE soundbar on its own has remarkable bass performance that will satisfy the majority of users, we know that for some there is simply never too much bass. We salute those enthusiasts and offer the PULSE sub,” notes John Banks, chief brand officer, Bluesound. “Of course adding the PULSE sub will truly deliver that very last octave or two of low frequencies from their favorite movies or music. And this sub is so compact and versatile, that it can be located almost anywhere. So we believe the PULSE sub will be a welcome addition for those customers who either have the PULSE soundbar or any soundbar.”

	Placement options for the PULSE sub include vertical placement behind a couch or any other piece of furniture. It features a 100-watt continuous Class D amplifier to power the PULSE sub’s 6.5-inch woofer, and it states the sub’s rated frequency response is 26Hz to 150Hz.

	<h1>money mistakes</h1>
	<h2>Spending too much on housing</h2>
	<section>

	It’s easy to spend too much on housing—especially if you live in a big city. According to one longstanding rule of thumb, you shouldn’t spend more than 30% of your pretax income on housing. That’s not a bad start, but the 30% figure may or may not work for you.
	The amount you decide to spend on housing depends on your personal financial situation and the things you want to do with your money. For instance, many young people have high debt burdens from student loans that eat up much of their take-home pay. The class of 2015 graduated with a record level of student loan debt, an average of $35,051.1
	Add in the still-recovering job market and the result is that many young adults are still living with their parents. More than one in four young people, not including 18- to 24-year-olds attending college full time, lived with their parents in 2015— and nearly half of millennials not enrolled in college lived with a roommate last year.2
	Choosing to live with parents or roommates is a great strategy that can help your finances in the long run. Once you're ready to live on your own, be sure that your housing costs don't jeopardize your long-term goals.

	Not saving for retirement
		Putting off saving for your future is a common problem. It is so very far away, and there is so much to spend money on now. We tend to place a higher value on short-term than long-term benefits, even when we know the long term is more important.
		Another obstacle is lack of money. Many young adults feel like they can’t save enough to make a difference. But saving even a little bit matters, especially early in your career. That’s because time is on your side. You have plenty of years for the power of compounding to work for you.
		Here's what that means: Money you invest can earn more money, and over time those earnings can generate earnings of their own. The result is that the earlier you start saving, the less you have to save.
